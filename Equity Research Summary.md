#### What is a 13F filing?

A 13F filing is a quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in equity assets under management (AUM). This requirement was established under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The purpose of the 13F filing is to provide transparency into the investment holdings of institutional investors, offering a public snapshot of their investment positions in U.S. equity securities that trade on exchanges at the end of each quarter.

The contents of a 13F filing include details such as the names of the equity securities, the class of shares, the CUSIP number (a unique identifier for securities), and the number of shares held by the institutional investor. It also reports the total value of each holding. However, it's important to note that 13F filings do not include non-equity securities, such as bonds or warrants, private investments, nor do they disclose short positions or international equities.
