## Financial Terms Definitions

This document provides definitions for several key financial terms that are essential for understanding a company's financial health and performance.

## Definitions:

#### Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
ROCE is a financial ratio that measures a company's profitability and efficiency in using its capital. It is calculated by dividing the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by the capital employed (total assets minus current liabilities). This ratio shows how well a company is generating profits from its capital, making it useful for comparing profitability across companies and industries.

#### Gross Margin
Gross margin is a company's net sales revenue minus its cost of goods sold (COGS), expressed as a percentage of net sales revenue. It indicates the efficiency with which a company produces its goods and services, showing how much revenue exceeds the cost of goods sold. A higher gross margin means the company retains more from each dollar of sales to cover other costs.

#### Operating Profit Margin
The operating profit margin is a profitability ratio that measures the percentage of profit a company makes from its operations, relative to its revenue. Calculated by dividing operating profit (EBIT) by net sales, it reflects the efficiency in converting sales into pre-tax profits, excluding the effects of interest and taxes.

#### Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)
The cash conversion cycle measures how quickly a company can convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales. It evaluates the efficiency of managing inventory, receivables, and payables. A shorter CCC indicates better cash management and operational efficiency.

#### Leverage
Leverage refers to the use of borrowed funds (debt) to finance the acquisition of assets or operations with the aim of increasing returns. While it can amplify profits, it also increases the risk due to the obligation of interest payments and potential for greater earnings volatility.

#### Interest Cover
Interest cover, or the interest coverage ratio, measures a company's ability to make interest payments on its debt with its earnings. It is calculated by dividing earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by interest expenses. A higher ratio suggests a stronger ability to meet interest obligations, indicating lower financial risk.
